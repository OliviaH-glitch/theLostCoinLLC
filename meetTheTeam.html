        <h2>Lynette</h2>
        <p>Lynette operates and manages The Lost Coin, LLC, deploying over 30+ years as a Certified Public Accountant
            (CPA). She has been licensed through the State of Missouri since 2013. She is also a Certified Fraud
            Examiner (CFE) credentialed by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, and she holds a Certificate in
            Financial Forensics (CFF) through the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Lynette obtained a
            Bachelor of Science degree in Accountancy from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Master
            of Science degree in Economic Crime Management from Utica College in New York.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lynette began her accounting career with then prestigious Arthur Andersen & Co as an auditor. She spent
            nearly 10 years in various internal audit, accounting, and finance positions at Hewlett-Packard Company, and
            also has extensive experience as a real estate investor. She has prepared hundreds of individual and
            corporate tax returns and payroll tax filings. More recently, she spent two years in New Orleans performing
            fraud investigation and forensic accounting work for the largest class-action court ordered settlement
            program in the history of the United States. She also spent nearly a year investigating allegations of
            embezzlement at a closely-held family business, identifying stolen funds in excess of $1.6 million along
            with fraudulently filed corporate tax returns and quarterly payroll reports. From her public accounting
            roots at the largest and most respected global accounting firm in the world to her years in Corporate
            America to her consulting experience with small family businesses, Lynette has developed a proven track
            record as a well-rounded finance professional.</p>
